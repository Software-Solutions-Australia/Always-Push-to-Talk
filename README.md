### Always Push-to-Talk by Software Solutions Australia (Disguise_AU)

Always PTT will keep your default capture device (your mic) muted unless an assigned push-to-talk key is being pressed.

Always PTT is designed for Windows 10 and has not been tested on any other versions of Windows.

## FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS:

* Assign a push-to-talk key that works universally across all programs and games in Windows.

* Keeps microphone properly muted which is great for privacy when not using the mic.

* An On-Screen-Display (OSD) to show when the mic is active (can be enabled from the settings and you can change the position and size of the OSD).

* Beep when mic is activated and deactivated (can be enabled in settings).

* Less than 3MB in size and uses only a small amount of memory to operate.

* Option to run at Windows startup (can be enabled in settings).

## TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you have set a default device and Always PTT hasn't detected it even after restarting Always PTT. Restart your computer.

If Always PTT doesn't work with a particular game or program (such as Discord), run Always PTT as administrator.

If you still have problems with this program, try reading the instructions again and follow them carefully.
