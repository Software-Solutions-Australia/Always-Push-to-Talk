### Always Push-to-Talk by Software Solutions Australia (Disguise_AU)

Always PTT will keep your default capture device (your mic) muted unless an assigned push-to-talk key is being pressed.

It will only work with whichever recording device you have set as your default.

This program by default will set the CapsLock key as a universal push-to-talk (PTT) key while Always PTT is running.

It will appear as an icon in the task tray which has a menu when you right-click on the icon.

You can set another key to be the push-to-talk key by right clicking the Always PTT icon in the Windows task tray (bottom right of your screen), hover your mouse over the "Assign Push-to-Talk Key" menu, from there you can select various keys to use as your push-to-talk key.

Always PTT is designed for Windows 10 and has not been tested on any other versions of Windows.

You can exit Always PTT and set the assigned push-to-talk key back to its original functionality by right clicking on the Always PTT icon in the task tray and selecting the "Exit and Unmute Mic" option.
